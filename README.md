48 hrs Crunch!

CRUD APP->LABYRINTH DUNGEON CRAWLER (Random encounters!!!)

Initial goal was to get a full CRUD app functional, but I ran into issues with the web pack and the package.json.

DEPENDENCIES
After installing each component piece by piece, I reached a point where mutual conflicting dependencies killed the app.

WEBPACK
Another technical issue where the webpack deleted the bundle. No matter how many times I ran the web pack, the bundle refused to regenerate. I managed to circumvent this issue by dumping a bundle.js from another project into my backend.

9 hrs left: REACT
With that issue resolved, I focused on deepening my knowledge of React. I wrote the additional game logic code on top of an older project - this project's logic is still partially embedded in the working code, pending extrication later.

GAME STATE AND GAME BUTTONS

BATTLES STAIRS LEVELS MONSTERS
I wanted to get all of the game logic and state manipulation working.

BUGS
Switch cases are tricky! One of my breaks was missing and caused a long bug fix session!

EXTENSIONS: save to local storage - no time

Maybe make it into a chrome extension?
